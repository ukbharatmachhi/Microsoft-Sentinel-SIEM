We are working with a real estate client who seeks to enhance their security posture and improve their SOC (Security Operations Center) operations. The company is looking to monitor their IT infrastructure in real-time and gain deeper insights into potential security threats across their environment. 
As a Security Consultant, my goal is to implement Microsoft Sentinel as a cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solution, designed to deliver intelligent security analytics and robust threat detection capabilities. This repository serves as a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for managing SOC operations using Microsoft Sentinel. It covers key processes, including:

1) Onboarding Microsoft Sentinel into client environments.
2) Integrating security logs from diverse sources to establish a unified infrastructure view.
3) Developing custom analytic rules to detect potential security threats.
4) Designing interactive dashboards to enhance visibility and monitoring.
5) Leveraging KQL (Kusto Query Language) for advanced data analysis and threat hunting.

The repository is intended to provide detailed instructions and best practices for optimizing security operations, ensuring efficient incident detection and response, and enhancing overall infrastructure security.

## Objective

The primary objective is to set up and manage a comprehensive security monitoring system that will:
1) Streamline SOC operations by integrating real-time data feeds and automating threat detection.
2) Enhance visibility into the infrastructure, including on-premises and cloud environments, enabling rapid identification and response to security incidents.
3) Centralize threat intelligence across the organization to ensure proactive monitoring, threat detection, and incident management.
