# Analytic Rules
Analytic rules in Microsoft Sentinel are used to detect suspicious activities, security threats, and anomalous behavior by analyzing log data from different sources. These rules help in automating threat detection and triggering alerts or responses when predefined conditions are met.

## Types of Analytic Rules in Microsoft Sentinel
**1. Scheduled Query Rules** – Run KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries on a schedule to detect threats.

**2. Fusion Rules** – Use AI-based correlation to detect multi-stage attacks.

**3. ML-based Rules** – Utilize machine learning models for advanced threat detection.

In the real estate industry, Microsoft Sentinel Analytic Rules play a crucial role in enhancing cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and smart building security. By continuously monitoring property management systems, financial transactions, smart IoT devices, and employee activities, these rules help detect unauthorized access, phishing attacks, wire fraud, and insider threats.

With automated threat detection and response, real estate firms can safeguard sensitive tenant data, prevent financial losses, and ensure compliance with security regulations.
