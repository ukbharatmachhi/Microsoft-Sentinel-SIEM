# Onboarding Data Sources in Microsoft Sentinel
Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration Automated Response) solution in Microsoft Azure. Onboarding data sources is a critical step to ensure comprehensive security monitoring and threat detection.

For a real estate client, onboarding data sources in Microsoft Sentinel enhances cybersecurity by monitoring property management systems, financial transactions, IoT security, and cloud infrastructure. By integrating logs and automating responses, organizations can detect fraud, prevent unauthorized access, and improve overall security posture.

By leveraging Content Hub, we integrated various security solutions such as Entra Id, Microsoft Defender Endpoint, Microsoft Defender Cloud, Office 365, AWS Cloud Trial, Web Application Firewall, and other third-party tools, ensuring comprehensive log ingestion, real-time monitoring, and automated response workflows. This streamlined approach allows security teams to detect, investigate, and mitigate threats efficiently without manually configuring each component.

## Understanding the Real Estate Client’s Needs
A real estate company typically deals with:

1. Property Management Systems (e.g., Yardi, AppFolio)
2. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot)
3. Cloud Services (e.g., Microsoft 365, AWS, Azure)
4. Website & Application Logs (e.g., Property listing platforms, APIs)
5. Financial Transactions & Payment Gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
6. IoT & Smart Building Systems (e.g., Smart locks, surveillance cameras)

To enhance security, Sentinel should ingest logs from these data sources to detect threats such as fraud, unauthorized access, and cyberattacks.

## Steps to Onboard Data Sources in Microsoft Sentinel
### Connect Data Sources
Microsoft Sentinel provides built-in connectors for common services and allows custom log ingestion for others.

#### Native Connectors for Cloud & IT Infrastructure
1. Entra ID → Detect suspicious logins, MFA bypass attempts.
2. Microsoft Defender → Monitor security alerts from Defender for Endpoint, Office 365, and Cloud Apps.
3. AWS CloudTrail & GCP Logs → Capture cloud activity logs if the real estate firm uses multi-cloud setups.

#### Security & Network Device Integration
1. Firewalls & VPNs (e.g., Cisco, Palo Alto) → Identify unusual traffic or unauthorized access.
2. Endpoint Security (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, CrowdStrike) → Detect malware on employee devices.

#### Custom Log Sources for Real Estate-Specific Systems
Since property management platforms may not have native Sentinel connectors, you can use:

1. Syslog or Common Event Format (CEF) for SIEM-compatible applications.
2. API & Logic Apps to ingest logs from CRM or payment systems (e.g., connecting Salesforce via API).
3. Azure Data Explorer for analyzing structured financial transactions.

#### IoT & Physical Security
1. Security Cameras & Smart Locks → Ingest logs from building security systems to detect unauthorized entry.
2. IoT Device Logs → Identify vulnerabilities in smart home technology.
